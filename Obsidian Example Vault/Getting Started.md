# Getting Started

In order to stay organized, I use Obsidian to track my personal knowledge management (PKM), tasks, projects and activities.

## What is Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)?
- Personal knowledge management (PKM) is the process of collecting all information relevant to our daily activities and jobs. PKM allows us to free up space in our brains and builds a reliable system of tracking and recalling knowledge when it's needed.

## Why Obsidian?
* There are several benefits of using Obsidian over other notetaking applications, especially in reference to PKM

### Flexibility
* Obsidian gives us the flexibility to take notes how we want, to lay them out in ways that we design and find meaningful and to personalize the notebook structure in ways that maximize our efficiency
* This example vault is set up in the way that I find to be most efficient, but everything can be changed as you see fit!
* The theme, colors, hotkeys and side panels can all be changed
* Since there are hundreds of extensions and plug-ins available, almost any functionality you need can be added to the application

### Backlinks
* Backlinks in Obsidian are connections made to files, notes or even sections of notes to quickly see how information is related. It also creates a quick and easy way to navigate through the notebook
* While other notetaking applications have the ability to link to individual notes, backlinks make it easier to do

### Local Storage
* Every note and file within Obsidian is stored locally on your computer. The entire notebook is a folder in your documents folder, with all of the subfolders you create.
* If you want to share a note with someone else, that note can be emailed or copied from that folder without even needing to open Obsidian.
* Since everything is written in Markdown, the person you are sending can open and read your notes without even needing Obsidian (though, notes can also be exported as PDFs!). If they do have Obsidian, the person you send your notes to will be able to open the note with all of your editing in place
* If Obsidian ever stopped working for any reason, all of your information will still be available outside of the application
* This is also why entire vaults can be exported and replicated without issue!

### Metadata and Querying
* You can give every note and file any metadata you would like and change it whenever you need to
* This allows you to query the information from anywhere within your vault to pull into tables and graphs elsewhere within the same vault
* Some examples of this, as you will see in my "Home Dashboard", are the tasks and upcoming meetings
	* I've written a query that pulls all tasks from across the vault and displays it on my dashboard, I've also written a query which gives me a list of upcoming meetings, the time of the meeting and the purpose of the meeting

### Templates
* Obsidian allows you to create custom templates for notes and note types
* You can then map these template to specific hotkeys and have them automatically saved in specific places within your vault
* These templates can include specific layouts, specific names and metadata
* For example, I have a "Meeting Notes" template, which automatically saves my note in the meeting notes folder. If gives it a specific layout that I use for all of my meeting notes and assigns it metadata and tags for querying later (including the date, purpose and related project)

### JavaScript and HTML
* While the application itself is Electron based, you can create custom functions within using JavaScript
	* This is how I've been able to create columns and the Tasks Calendar you see in the right sidepanel
* This also allows you to write even more sophisticated queries for the information in your vault
* Since Obsidian relies on Markdown for its notes, you can also use HTML to format those even further
* Fortunately, neither JavaScript or HTML are necessary to use the application! They are just great additions if you're looking for more flexibility.

### Community
* Obsidian is an incredibly popular platform. Because of that, there is an enormous community of users who all have different solutions for their PKM systems
* If there is something you are interested in doing with Obsidian, or aren't sure how to get started, there are tons of resources and answers available!

## What is Markdown anyway?
* Markdown is a markup language for editing and formatting plain text
* Fortunately, Obsidian has mapped most of the common basic [[Hotkeys|hotkeys]] for things like **bold** and *italics*
* I've also included a [[Markdown Cheatsheet|cheatsheet]] for reference!

## How do I get Obsidian?
* Obsidian can be downloaded from [here](https://obsidian.md/)
* When you first open a new vault, you will be met with a plain white text editor and a left sidebar for navigation. However, you can replicate my vault to get you started with some basic plug-ins and theming.
* To do so:
	* Download this vault from GitHub and once you have the application installed, select "Open Vault from Folder", then point it to this vault

* Again, this vault has been setup in a way that makes the most sense for me and my workflow. That being said, I hope you find it to be a great jumping off point as you learn Obsidian and customize it to your own workflows!
