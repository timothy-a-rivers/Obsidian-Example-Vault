# Hotkeys

Hotkeys can be viewed, searched and edited in the Settings menu.

```ad-summary

This most important Hotkey in Obsidian is Ctrl + P. This opens the action menu. If you can't remember the hotkey for an action, typing CTRL + P will open then menu, let you search the action then perform it.
```

## Native Hotkeys
```
CTRL + P: Action menu
CTRL + E: Switch between editing and reading mode
	I like to default to reading mode so I don't see any of the code
CTRL + N: Open a new note
	I've set my new notes to go into the Inbox by default
CTRL + B: Bold
CTRL + I: Italics
CTRL + T: New tab
```

## Custom Hotkeys
```
These are just hotkeys that I've created for my vault.

ALT + M: New meeting note
ALT + E: New email note
ALT + I: Add a task to the task inbox
ALT + T: Create a new task here
ALT + H: Go to the Home Dashboard
ALT + A: Insert new Admonition
	This is a plugin I'm using to create callouts.
```
